## Rationale

Group chat and DMs are a type of database. It is a collection of images, links, news articles, and commentary. 
Much of this gets lost in the ever growing feed. What if there was a way to surface relevant information in different
types of views? This project hopes to enable that sort of functionality by providing a way to view all news links in a
new reader layout.
